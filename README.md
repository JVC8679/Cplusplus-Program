# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to take a list of veggies and count how many times they appeared in a list. The project had 3 parts. First was how many times they appeared. The second was to be able to pick a veggie and get how many times they were sold. The Third was to make a histogram of the list. 

# What did you do particularly well?
At first I had if and if else statements for the menu options.  Realizing there was a better way to do it it changed it to a switch statement which was easier to read and modify. I also modified the open file statements to auto close. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The printHistogram could be in its own file for better readability and portability. I believe there was a better way of iterating through the list without using for statements. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I first wrote all the Python functions by opening and closing the files manually and it all worked with not errors. After changing it to with open it started throwing errors that I did not recognize in the code ( code that was given to us by instructor so I did not completely understand it). It changed the returns on the functions so I had to modify it make it compatible.    

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The reason I picked this project to put in the portfolio is because it included a second language. Including multiple languages into one project is a valuable skill.  

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The program is broken up into multiple files and sections making it maintainable, readable, and adaptable by grouping the functions together and leaving the main program clean and uncluttered.
